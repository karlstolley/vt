	<h2 class="lessig">Technological Literacies</h2>

	<h2>Selfe: “Official” Tech Literacies</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			[Those] technological literacy skills and practices associated with
			official efforts are generally considered useful and appropriate...
			<cite><em>Technology and Literacy in the Twenty-First Century</em>, 1999</cite>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Selfe: “Nonofficial” Tech Literacies</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			...[but] those technological literacies associated with nonofficial
			situations and settings are often considered to be either problematic...or
			outside the official realm of technological literacy altogether.
			<cite><em>Technology and Literacy in the Twenty-First Century</em>, 1999</cite>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Selfe: Stolley-editorialized Example</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Within the daily operations of the <del>workplace</del> <ins>writing
			classroom</ins>, <del>employees</del> <ins>students</ins> come to
			understand that some computer tools and activities are seen as more useful,
			more focused on <del>corporate</del> <ins>product-based</ins> outcomes, more
			productive—and hence more official—than others.
			<cite><em>Technology and Literacy in the Twenty-First Century</em>, 1999</cite>

	<h2 class="lessig">In digital composing, process easily goes out the window.</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">How can you revise what you can’t see?</h2>

	<h2>Crafton: Revision & GUIs</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			User-friendly point-and-click software may actually disguise the ways the
			medium acts as a metaphor. We cannot see how technology conditions the
			expression or how it operates as a model, a cognitive struture, that
			organizes our thinking.
			<cite>“Promises, Promises,” <em>Computers and Composition 13</em>, 1996</cite>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2 class="lessig">Digital writers prefer pointing and clicking to writing.</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">Wait, what?</h2>

	<h2>Rushkoff: Writing and Programming</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Computers and networks...offer us the ability to write. And we do write
			with them on our websites, blogs, and social networks....
			<cite><em>Program or Be Programmed</em>, 2010</cite>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Rushkoff: Writing and Programming</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			...But the underlying capability of the computer era is actually
			programming—which almost none of us knows how to do. We simply use the
			programs that have been made for us, and enter our text in the appropriate
			box on the screen.
			<cite><em>Program or Be Programmed</em>, 2010</cite>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2 class="lessig">Through the GUI, writers are conditioned to <strong>outsource</strong> process.</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">What if process were <strong>open source</strong> instead?</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">Remainder of this talk:</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">Linux &amp; Open Source as a Model of Revision</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">Revision Control and Open Source Writing: A Demonstration</h2>

	<h2 class="lessig">A Plan for Action</h2>

	<h2>A Plan for Action</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Take your writing open source:</strong> Learn XHTML, CSS, and
		JavaScript, and compose as many things as possible with them.</li>
		<li><strong>Upgrade your operating system:</strong> Install and use Linux or
		a Unix-like OS (e.g., Mac OS X); become familiar with the command line.</li>
		<li><strong>Make history:</strong> Install and configure Git, and put all of
		your open-source writing projects under Git control.</li>
	</ol>
